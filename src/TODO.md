# TODOs

### Missing Tests:

- DYNAMIC `ieee80211n`: Replace the mocked output for legacy WIFI modules.


### Broken Tests
- `driver` should be set to nl80211
- `channel` should be read from file
- `bssid` gets set from the wrong interface.


### Clean-Up
- `password` should be read from file
- `Dnsmasq` should be removed
- `Config` should be specialized
- `Network#enabled?` should be removed
- `Interface` class should be castrated
- `Network` class should be castrated
- 2nd definition of `Console` class should be removed
- Refactor the rest...
